# AAOC Calculator

AAOC stands for Average Age of Credit. I have been a credit freak ever since I got my first credit card.
Every credit tracker shows length of dates, and how long. However I decided to visualize it further, and plan to 
implement a feature to allow planning credits. For example Since I have 4 credit pipes open. I plan to get a new 
credit card, however I want to keep my AAOC around 3 years. If I opened one right now what would it be? OR! If I want to open
a new credit line, and have my AAOC be 3 years, what date should I open it to! This is a fun project, and I plan to refine it further.

Enjoy! If any bugs are found or there is a feature you would like, please [open an issue](../../issues).
